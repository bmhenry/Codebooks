Codebooks
Copyright (c) 2015 Brandon Henry


A better README will be put here later.

For now, you should be able to figure out the program easily. A codebook stores entries, with each entry being a place to store your code as well as a description.

In the description file for an entry, you can add tags that will be searchable via the search bar at the top. This search bar will only look through the entries in the currently selected codebook.


To run the program, double-click codebooks.pyw or run it from the command line with 'python codebooks.pyw'
